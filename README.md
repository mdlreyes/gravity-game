# gravity-game

This is a demo titled "Star Warps," originally designed for a gravitational lensing demo at an open house at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. 

There are two parts of the demo: 
1) GravityGame.py, a game in which players place are given pictures of "gravitationally-lensed" astronomical objects, and they place "dark matter halos" of different distances and masses to de-lens the image.
2) camera.py, in which players can take webcam pictures of themselves and "lens" them.
