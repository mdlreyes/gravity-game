# gravity-game

This is a demo titled "Star Warps," originally designed for a gravitational lensing demo at an open house at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. 

There are two parts of the demo: 
1) GravityGame.py, a game in which players place are given pictures of "gravitationally-lensed" astronomical objects, and they place "dark matter halos" of different distances and masses to de-lens the image.
2) camera.py, in which players can take webcam pictures of themselves and "lens" them.

## Getting Started

Enter the GravityGame folder and run either GravityGame.py or camera.py:

```
python GravityGame.py
```

## Prerequisites

You'll need some Python modules: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [wxpython](https://www.wxpython.org/) for GravityGame.py, plus [OpenCV](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python) for camera.py
